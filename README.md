## Requirements

This repo should only have basic pytorch and huggingface requirements. The following should install all that is needed (so far)

```bash
pip install datasets timm lightning
```

## Usage

Please take a look at this initial prototyping notebook to see how the data looks like and how to use it: [notebook](notebooks/dev/ConvolutionalPrototyping.ipynb)
